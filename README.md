## nytpu's notes:

* you need to be using the chip.jfpossibilities.com repos before running this.
  [see here](http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/chip/debian/)
* **Do not attempt to install this if you're not on Debian Jessie**.  It *will*
  break your system in unpredictable ways.  If you're upgrading a system from
  a fresh flash, install PocketDesk before updating to Stretch/Buster.

## Introducing _**PocketDESK**_

What is _**PocketDESK**_?.

PocketDESK is a way to run the normal _Desktop GUI_ on your _PocketCHIP_ without any hassle. 

_Does the keyboard work?_  **Yes sir**

_Does the touchscreen work?_  **Yes sir**

_Can i run this next to the normal PocketHome?_ **YES SIR**


The install is super simple.

Just run

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install git

    git clone git://git.nytpu.com/forks/PocketDesk

    sudo ./PocketDesk/PocketDESK.sh

That is it. Do a reboot and you are good to go.

## How to use!


The point of **_PocketDESK_** is that you can switch between the normal **Desktop GUI** and **PocketHome**

To do this simply log out of whatever you booted into

**PocketHome:** (_See.. I put a button there for you'all_)
